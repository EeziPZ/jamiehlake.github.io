							<h3>Summary:</h3>
							<p>Inspira Features provides an array of tools and resources for the film industry, including storyboards and voiceovers. This was the first paying client for me and the project involved the customization of a WordPress theme and implementation of Elementor to allow for easy future updates and changes.</p>
							<h3>Challenges Overcome:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>The client had a specific design vision and wanted the ability to make changes easily.</li>
								<li>To accommodate the client's needs, I customized a WordPress theme and Elementor was utilized to make it simple for the client to make changes on their own.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Client Testimonial:</h3>
							<p><em>"I was having issues with my previous web design company when a friend recommended Jamie. I was blown away by his commitment to customer service. He was able to fulfill all my requests and kept me updated with instructional videos to ensure I was satisfied with the design. Compared to my previous designers, Jamie was able to provide the customization I needed at a more reasonable cost."</em></p>

							<h3>Summary:</h3>
							<p>The Meadows At Millstream is a luxurious self-catering accommodation that was brought to life with a custom-designed WordPress theme.</p><p> Initially, the website had its own built-in booking system that utilized WooCommerce for payments. However, once the client started listing the property on other local platforms, we switched to an external booking service that could seamlessly integrate with these listings.</p>
							<h3>Challenges Overcome:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Setting up the booking system was a significant challenge during the development process.</li>
								<li>The booking system needed to accept payments in South African Rands</li>
								<li>The booking system had to dynamically adjust the cost based on the cottage selected and the number of guests.
	</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Client Testimonial:</h3>
							<p><em>"Jamie exceeded my expectations with the website development. He kept me in the loop throughout the process and welcomed my input. The easy-to-follow documentation he provided allowed me to make updates on my own, and he was always available to help when needed. The website has significantly boosted bookings since its launch."</em></p>
